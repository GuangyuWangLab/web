Research
==================

The broad goals of the research in the Wang lab are to understand:

How epigenetics regulates transcriptome 

How transcriptional shifts affect cell states and cell/tissue level phenotypes


To achieve our goal, we are motivated by modulating the causes of transcriptional shifts and the translational potential of identifying. We develop and apply computational tools to integrate and interpret large biomedical and molecular datasets that can uncover the regulation mechanism and the effects of the transcriptional process.
