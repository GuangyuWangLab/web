["RESEARCH","<div><div>The broad goals of the research in the Wang lab are to understand:</div><div> • How epigenetics regulates transcriptome</div><div> • How transcriptional shifts affect cell states and cell/tissue level phenotypes</div><div>To achieve our goal, we are motivated by modulating the causes of transcriptional shifts and the translational potential of identifying. We develop and apply computational tools to integrate and interpret large biomedical and molecular datasets that can uncover the regulation mechanism and the effects of the transcriptional process. Specifically, we aim to utilize high-throughput multi-omics datasets, mostly based on DNA and RNA sequencing, to develop models that explain how cell state is regulated. We are especially interested in endothelial cells (ECs), covering various aspects of their biology, such as their differentiation and trans-differentiation, and the stability/plasticity of their chromatin structure and histone modification.</div><div><br></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 19pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">AI &amp; Machine learning in Computational Biology:</span><span style=\"font-size: 19pt;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Calibri Light&quot;, sans-serif;\">Data-driven research in Wang lab is powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning that guide us to understand more about biological systems and processes.

We have developed computational methods to investigate cell identity-associated TADs (topological associated domains), stripes, and loops. We initially detected split and merging of TADs comparing fibroblast to ECs and suggested these TAD splitting and merging may play important role in cell differentiation and are highly associated with histone modification alternation (Wang et al, <i>Genome Biology</i>, 2020). We also developed computational methods that decipher open chromatin, histone modification, and transcription factor binding genome-wide in sub-populations of cells undergoing dynamic processes such as differentiation or stochastic state switching (Wang et al, <i>Nature Communication</i>, 2020; Wang et al, <i>GPB</i>, 2021).<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Calibri Light&quot;, sans-serif;\"><br></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 19pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;\">Single-cell dynamics:<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot; Roboto&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium;\">Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) and single-cell epigenomics (scATAC-seq) data revolutionize the field of regulatory genomics.
